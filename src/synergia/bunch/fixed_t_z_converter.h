/// Fixed_t_z_converter is a virtual base class for converters

/// fixed-t representation

/// There are three converters one can choose:
///   1. Fixed_t_z_alex: the most general, considers the horizontal motion (beta_x_i and
///       beta_y_i  or particles not zeros) and the reference time and z are the ones for the
///       reference particle.
///   2.  Fixed_t_z_synergia20 corresponds to the old version of synergia, obtained from
///       Fixed_t_z_alex by making beta_x=0, beta_y=0, (1-beta*beta_z_i) =gamma^-2. Notice
///       that this approximation condisers different velocities along z direction for particles
///       i.e. in general  beta_z_i != beta.
///   3.  Fixed_t_z_zeroth: zeroth order approximation, obtained from  Fixed_t_z_alex
///       by making beta_x_i=beta_y_i=0 and beta_z_i = beta.
